        "\n",
        "In most cases, GPT performed well and selected the appropriate tables accurately. For example, when asked about employees who received bonuses and had degrees, it correctly chose the salary and studies tables. It also gave reasonable short labels for each selected table, which matched the table definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Weak Variations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Some variations were less reliable:\n",
        "\n",
        "Questions that involved indirect logic (e.g., \"worked in more than one department\") sometimes caused GPT to guess and include irrelevant tables like salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract or vague questions, especially ones combining multiple timelines (e.g., graduation vs. hiring), sometimes resulted in incomplete or inconsistent table selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "In rare cases, GPT hallucinated fields that weren't mentioned in any table description.\n",
        "\n",
        "What I Learned:\n",
        "\n",
        "-Clear, specific questions lead to better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "-GPT struggles with vague or overly complex conditions unless the table descriptions are detailed.\n",
        "\n",
        "-It's important to test multiple prompt phrasings to find the most effective structure."
